ERRORS

// commit failed - exit code 128 received, with output: 'fatal: unable to write new_index file'
-- PROB: This occurs when trying to commit a file with the same name and type but different encoding, e.g. changing a .txt file from
--       ANSI to Unicode in local. The local Unicode is incompatible with the git ANSI.
-- SOLN: Delete the git version and then commit the file, cloning the file instead of trying (and failing) to update it. You may get a merge
--       conflict; just resolve it by selecting the modify change rather than the delete change.


//git command could not be found and could not find ssh-agent
-- PROB: Github Desktop updated (likely automatically) and now there's conflict between the old and new version.
-- SOLN: Go to AppData > Local > GitHubDesktop and delete all the app-x.x.x except the latest one (e.g. there is app-2.5.2 and app-1.15.3,
--       delete app-1.15.3)
